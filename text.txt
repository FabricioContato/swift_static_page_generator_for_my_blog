#top-card-title I coded my own static page builder
 #p What about software to speed up blog post building… No! I’m not using any CMS, and I’m not even using any third-party tool for it. I coded my own solution.

 #p In short, I have a job that requires me to learn the Swift language. So what’s the best way to learn a new language, if not by building a project in that language? And why not build a project that also helps with my personal work? Once again, I’m killing two birds with one codebase.

#card-title Static Page Builder
 #p Many people don’t need to deal with HTML, CSS, and JS to write a webpage. They can use a static page builder. That kind of software allows you to focus on writing your content and uses a very simple code syntax, which will later be parsed into HTML, CSS, and JS code for you. The downside may be that they’re not very customizable, since how the parsing is done is set by the tool’s developer.

 #p My project idea would allow me to write a file for my blog post, and then, with a few clicks, a program would read my file and generate an output file—like output.html—with all the HTML, CSS, and JS my blog post uses.
